            <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
            <p>JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.</p>
            <code>function greetMe(yourName) { alert("Hello " + yourName); }</code>
            <li>Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).</li>

        <section class="main-section" id="About_Me">
            <header>About Me</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally different in some others.</p>
            <p>The JavaScript language resembles Java but does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking. JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.</p>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas.</li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="About_Coding">
            <header>About Coding</header>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
            <p>It is advisable to not use simple assignments in a conditional expression, because the assignment can be confused with equality when glancing over the code. For example, do not use the following code:</p>
            <code>greetMe("World");</code>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Github">
            <header>Github</header>
            <p>Global variables are in fact properties of the global object. In web pages the global object is window, so you can set and access global variables using the window.variable syntax.</p>
            <p>You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
            <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
            <li>It has to be initialized to a value.</li>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Social_Networks">
            <header>Social Networks</header>
            <p>The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables.</p>
            <p>You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable in the same scope. For example:</p>
            <code>// THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                //statements }</code>
            <li>However, object attributes are not protected.</li>
